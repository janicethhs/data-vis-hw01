1.  **Reverse-engineering the grammar of graphics.**

2.  **Road traffic accidents in Edinburgh.**

3.  **NYC marathon winners.**
 + *(a) Distribution of marathon times of all runners:* The histogram shows the number of runners (y-value) in each NYC marathon time (x-value).The box plot shows the minimum and maximum marathon times (in hours) of NYC runners, as well as their median and average time. The box plot also shows that the 25% (Q3: 75th percentile)of NYC runners have a marathon time greater than around 2.4 hours, and 75% (Q1: 25th percentile) of marathon runners have a marathon time of below 2.4 hours.
 + *(b) Marathon times for men and women:* The side-by-side box plot compares the distribution of the marathon times for men and women, and it shows that on average men runners had a lower marathon time (hrs) than women runners. Further, women runners had a wider range of marathon times, with many values in the outlier. On the other hand, men runners showed more closely distributed marathon times.
 + *(c) Avoiding redundant information in the box plot:* I created a frequency polygon, which is good for displaying comparisons between two variables, which in this case would be the marathon times for men and women. Because a frequency polygraph also uses lines, rather than a filled area such as in the case of a histogram or a bar graph, the ink-to-data ratio of a frequency polygon does not differ too much from the box plot created in 3a. However, the ink-to-data ratio was much greater in the box plot created in 3b, as I filled the box plot with the colors red and blue, for women and men respectively.
 + *(d) Visualizing the marathon times of men and women over the years:* In this scatterplot, it shows the general trend of marathon times of men and women over the years, the division (men and women) distributed by color and shape.
 
4.  **US counties.**

5.  **Napoleonâ€™s march.**
